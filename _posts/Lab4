TryHackMe Tutorial: 

My first step was to hit “deploy machine” and start the attack box to open up the side panel. I then opened the firefox browser and pasted in the provided IP address into the search bar. Once there, I found the flag “flag{connection_verified}” and entered it into the answer box. 

 

TryHackMe OpenVPN:  

I downloaded the program and file from the access page it recommended that I download. Setting up the VPN, I followed the instructions to right click and import the file with my name. After importing the file, I hit connect and it popped up after a few seconds saying it was connected. It instructed me to type in the IP address and the flag was “flag{connection_verified}”
